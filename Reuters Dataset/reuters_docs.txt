the tower commission is scathing comments on president reagan is embattled chief of staff donald regan could signal the death knell to his white house tenure but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of reagan is worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to iran and diversion of profits to nicaraguan rebels first emerged last november but criticism of the roles of secretary of state george shultz and defense secretary caspar weinberger who said they opposed the iran arms initiative yet failed to end it had been muted until the release of the tower commission report their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or if they could not in conscience do that to so inform the president the report said after a three month probe instead they simply distanced themselves from the program they protected the record as to their own positions on this issue they were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages the report saved some of its most scathing language for regan a gruff former wall street executive and close personal friend of reagan whose autocratic rule in the white house angered some top reagan officials and perhaps more importantly reagan is wife nancy more than almost any chief of staff of recent memory he asserted personal control over the white house staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser said the report washington analysts said regan is departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the tower commission is findings next week with regan is departure apparently imminent and poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office the report is tough criticism of shultz and weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future senate republican leader robert dole a key reagan ally told reporters the report disclosed colossal blunders and said people who had not served the president well should step aside but he did not specify who should go it would seem to me that if you do not protect the president you do not serve the president well then you should move on the kansas republican a likely presidential candidate next year said one republican strategist said he believed regan would not be the only white house official to leave in the near future reuter
switzerland is economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said the oecd in its annual report on switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick up in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product growth to pct this year from an estimated two pct in and a small rise in consumer price inflation to pct after last year is sharp fall to pct from pct in but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the nation oecd area assuming an average exchange rate of swiss francs to the dollar this year against in the second half of the report forecast a pct rise in exports and a pct rise in imports this year after rises of pct and pct respectively in the faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp would shrink in both years but given switzerland is large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than gdp which if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the oecd said real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted in private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall gdp it added the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said as a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange the long term appreciation of the swiss franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required to preserve its competitive position it said reuter
